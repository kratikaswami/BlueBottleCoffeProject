## Blue Bottle Coffee - Data Engineer coding challenge.
I implemented this project as a POC and it was an amazing learning experience. I would like to thank you for this opportunity.

### Installation requirements
* python 3.6+ (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
* mysql server 5.7+ (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

### Running the project (Post-prerequisites)
* Navigate to the root directory of the project.
* *`python$ ProjectAutomation.py`*   (in the root directory of the project)

### Info
* The program is automated in such a way that it does the following:
	* Connects with local instance of mysql and creates a database named cafedb.
	* Creates the salesdata table and weather data tables.
	* Inserts data into the created tables from the csv files obtained.
	* Generated both the reports and saves the output for both in separate csv files.

### Future work based on learnings
* For learning purposes, I can leverage distributed technologies like Apache Spark or Hadoop for more scalable and efficient solution.
* Using python modules like Pandas and Numpy a lot of other analysis tasks can be performed and more inferences can drawn.
